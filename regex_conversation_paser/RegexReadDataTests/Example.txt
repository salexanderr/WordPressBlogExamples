user4 1330959751 It isn't supposed to be a comedy!!
user5 1330959759 That's why it's gold!
user4 1330959780 We should organise a night with the others, grab some wine and a takeaway and watch it again.

user4 1330959793 You are just too ignorant to grasp it's hidden underlying message
user6 1330959795 Yeah yeah! Whatever!
